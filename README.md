mynewportfolio

Overview
- This is a Next.js project (App Router) for a personal portfolio. Components live in `components/` and pages are in the `app/` directory.

How to run

1. Install dependencies:

	npm install

2. Start the development server:

	npm run dev

3. Build for production:

	npm run build

Notes
- The project uses Next.js 13+ (App Router), Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion and lucide-react for icons.
- If you see leftover Vite files (like `index.html`), they can be safely removed — this repo no longer needs Vite.
