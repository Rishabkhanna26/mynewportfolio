Conversion notes:
- This project was converted from a Vite + TypeScript React app to Next.js using plain JSX components.

How to run (after installing dependencies):

1. Install dependencies:
	npm install

2. Run the development server:
	npm run dev

The UI, styles and content were preserved exactly during conversion. Components live in `src/components` and pages are in `pages/`.
